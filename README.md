# Bank-Account-Simulation

**Objective**
A simple Java program that simulates basic bank operations such as **deposit**, **withdraw**, **check balance**, and **view transaction history** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

**Tools & Technologies**
- Java
- VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA / Any Java IDE
- Terminal / Command Prompt
  
**Features**
- Create a bank account with an initial deposit
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money (with balance check)
- Check current account balance
- View complete transaction history
- Menu-driven terminal interface

**OOP Concepts Used**
- Encapsulation → Private fields with public methods to access and modify data
